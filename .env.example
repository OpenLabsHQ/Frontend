# Example environment variables for OpenLabsX Frontend
# Copy this file to .env for local development
# For production, use .env.production or set at build time

# API URL - where to find the backend API
# Development: Leave empty to use Vite's proxy with relative URLs
# Production: Set to your actual API server URL

# to change the API URL without rebuilding the application
